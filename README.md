Coursera Module 9 W4 Peer Graded Assignment


## About

This repository contains R scripts for the shiny app created for the peer graded assignment. The scripts describe an app which takes user input and outputs distribution plots 
based on the input values of type of distribution, sample size and other corresponding parameters. It is a simple, basic app to test a few things out of the shiny module in R
which is quite amazing for interactive web apps.
